      "data": "<p>In the rush to \"go digital,\" many CEOs believe that the greatest risk lies in the development phase—bugs, missed deadlines, or technical debt. Consequently, they push their teams to start building as quickly as possible.</p><p>But at Orcamo, our experience with enterprise-level initiatives has revealed a different truth: <strong>Most digital transformation projects fail before the first line of code is ever written.</strong></p><p>Failure in the enterprise isn't usually a crash during deployment. It is a slow, expensive realization twelve months into a project that you have built a sophisticated solution for a problem that doesn't exist, or worse, a solution that the business cannot operationally absorb. When you skip the foundational work of discovery and governance, you aren't saving time; you are merely accelerating the rate at which you hit a wall.</p>"

      "data": "<p>In digital execution, speed is often confused with success. Leaders feel that \"activity\" equals \"progress.\" However, starting a complex digital initiative without a rigorous discovery phase is like flooring the accelerator while your tires are pointed at a ditch.</p><p>\"Failure before code\" happens when a project is greenlit based on a technical assumption rather than a business outcome. By the time the engineering team starts their first sprint, the project may already be doomed by:</p><ul><li><strong>A Vacuum of Vision:</strong> Departments have conflicting ideas of what \"success\" looks like.</li><li><strong>Invisible Metrics:</strong> No one has defined the specific P&L impact expected from the spend.</li><li><strong>The Accountability Void:</strong> Decision authority is murky, leading to \"death by committee\" later in the cycle.</li></ul>"

It is the process of translating executive intent into operational reality.</p><p>A disciplined Discovery Phase must bridge the gap between Business Goals and Technical Assumptions. It forces stakeholders to confront uncomfortable truths early:</p><p><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Does the COO's definition of \"efficiency\" match the CTO's definition of \"scalability\"?</p><p><strong>User Journeys:</strong> How do employees actually work? If your new tool ignores the 15 manual workarounds your staff currently uses, they will simply ignore the tool.</p><p><strong>Operational Constraints:</strong> Can your existing data architecture even support the new vision, or are you building on a foundation of sand?</p>"

Who has the final say when two departments disagree on a feature? Who owns the data once it leaves the legacy system?</p><p>Governance ensures:</p><ul><li><strong>Change Management:</strong> Preparing the human element of the business for the digital shift.</li><li><strong>Data Ownership:</strong> Establishing clear rules for security, privacy, and integrity from day one.</li><li><strong>Long-term Accountability:</strong> Ensuring the project delivers value long after the initial \"go-live\" hype has faded.</li></ul>"

      "data": "<p>We consistently see three errors that drain millions from enterprise budgets:</p><p><strong>Tool-First Thinking:</strong> Choosing a vendor (like Salesforce or SAP) before defining the business problem. This forces your business to fit the tool, rather than the tool serving the business.</p><p><strong>Vendor-Led Roadmaps:</strong> Allowing an outside consultant with a vested interest in \"more billable hours\" to dictate your strategic priorities.</p><p><strong>Skipping Discovery to \"Save Time\":</strong> This is the most expensive mistake a CEO can make. The cost of changing a requirement during discovery is negligible; the cost of changing it after the code is written is 100x higher.</p>"
