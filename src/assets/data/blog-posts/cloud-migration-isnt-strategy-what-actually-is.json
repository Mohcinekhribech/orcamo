      "data": "<p>In boardrooms across the globe, \"moving to the cloud\" is often spoken of as if it were a finish line. CEOs and boards approve massive budgets for cloud migration, expecting that once the data centers are shuttered and the workloads are hosted by a hyperscaler, the business will magically become more agile, innovative, and cost-efficient.</p><p>Here is the cold, hard reality: <strong>Cloud migration is a tactical move. It is not a strategy.</strong></p><p>At Orcamo, we have seen dozens of enterprises treat the cloud as a destination rather than a tool. The result? They don't transform; they just relocate their problems. Moving an inefficient, fragmented, and poorly governed on-premise infrastructure to the cloud doesn't fix it—it just makes it more expensive and harder to track.</p><p>If your migration plan starts with \"which provider,\" you have already lost the strategic plot.</p>"

      "data": "<p>For many organizations, the cloud has become a \"silent tax\" on growth. Without a coherent strategy, cloud migration often leads to three critical failures:</p><p><strong>The Lift-and-Shift Cost Trap:</strong> Taking a legacy application and dropping it into the cloud (Rehosting) without refactoring it is like moving an old, gas-guzzling engine into a sleek new chassis. You pay a premium for cloud elasticity that your rigid software can't even use.</p><p><strong>Increased Complexity, Decreased Control:</strong> Cloud environments are inherently decentralized. Without a pre-defined operating model, \"cloud sprawl\" sets in. Departments spin up resources independently, leading to a fragmented architecture that no one fully understands or secures.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Agility:</strong> If your internal processes—your approvals, your procurement, and your deployment cycles—are still tied to a 2010 mindset, the fastest cloud in the world won't help you ship products any faster.</p>"

For some enterprises, a hybrid or private cloud approach is the only way to meet specific regulatory or latency requirements.</p>"
